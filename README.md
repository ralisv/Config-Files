# Configuration Files
This repository is a collection of my configuration files for my personal linux machine.

# Home Manager
I use [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/) tool to manage
my dotfiles, packages, desktop environment, and various scripts. Its configuration can
be found in the "home-manager" top-level folder.

# Nixos
The Linux distribution of my choice is Nixos, system configuration files related to it are
under the "nixos" top-level folder. Parts of my it are tied to the particular
hardware model I use.
